# Roman numeral implementation

A basic implementation of Roman numerals that came out of some random weekend coding for fun. There was no other point
than fun relaxing programming. The definition of Roman numerals is based on the Wikipedia article at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals.

## CLI

Use the CLI to convert a single value at a time. Some examples:
- `roman-numerals convert 4` - outputs `IV`
- `roman-numerals convert IV` - outputs `4`
- `roman-numerals help` - print general help information
- `roman-numerals help convert` - print the help info for `convert`
- `roman-numerals --version` - print the version
